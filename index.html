                    <li>For the next two months it is our Ward's turn for cleaning the Church Building on 
                        Saturdays in preparation for Sunday worship services.   We divide up the Ward in 
                        fourths and each week you will be notified of your assignment via an text/email.  
                        The assigned last names for this week are M - S.  We’ll meet at 9am, and if we 
                        can all come it should take less than an hour. You can make up a missed assignment
                         on any Saturday, or months that have five Saturdays those that were not able to 
                         report for their assignment can report when there is a 5th Saturday.  Please make 
                         every effort to come help clean the building on your assigned week. </li>
                    <li>For all Youth, Parents, and Youth Leaders:  This evening @ 6pm, we will meet in the 
                        church Relief Society room to introduce the Children and Youth Program Overview and 
                        welcome our new youth for the year. Since the Children and Youth Program is run 
                        largely from the home, we'd love to have all parents attend to learn more about this 
                        program and how it can support their youth in setting and achieving meaningful goals.</li>
                    <li>Ward Youth mission prep will pick up again on the 4th Sunday of this month - Feb 25 -
